TODO:
* Verify 65816 core
* Check 65816 disassembler output
* Add save (and restore) of full sim state to a file (oh boy...)
* Figure out how to detect of the socket closed in the UART
* Clean up UART code
* Clean up UART interface
* Add UART to docs (help & README)
* Enable setting of UART port #
* Enable disabling of UART on startup so a port is not always requested to run the sim
* Add correct resetting of UART IRQ flags in IIR (16C750)

TODONE:
* Help menu (multi-level)
* Instruction history display
* Properly initialize hist and watch structs
* irq [set|clear]
* nmi [set|clear]
* Add memory store command syntax
* "exit" command
* "save" command -> dumps memory & CPU
* Add file loading
* move save/load to functions to enable cli arg loading of files
* Add cli loading of files
* Add commands 'cpu [reg] val' to directly modify the CPU
* Add "fast run mode"
* Add block write/read functions to memory_t wrapper functions (to facilitate overlay of simulated I/O devices)
* Add break points
* Optimize memory in memory_t so each address location doesn't take 64bits
* Add a socket listener (AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM) to emulate some form of UART (65C51 with and w/o TX flag bug)
* Manually changing the PC via commands incorrectly adds previous PC instruction to history. (Fix this)
* Add macro file or command line quoted command parsing
* Fix crash on F6 during RUN mode
* Pressing F12 while running does not exit
